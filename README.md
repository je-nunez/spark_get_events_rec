Get stages and tasks performance in Apache Spark (tested with Apache Spark 2.3.1)

The underlying example code to demo with performance data was taken from: [https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/examples/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/examples/ml/PipelineExample.scala](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/examples/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/examples/ml/PipelineExample.scala)

# WIP

This project is a *work in progress*. The implementation is *incomplete* and
subject to change. The documentation can be inaccurate.
